Task:
Your task is to thoroughly document the given C code. You should describe the program flow in a way that is understandable for both users and developers, and add appropriate comments to the code.

Procedure:
Understanding the Code:

Go through the code line by line and ensure that you understand the purpose of each line and function.
Discuss among yourselves or do some research if anything is unclear.
Documentation for Users:

Write a brief guide on how the program should be used. This guide should include:
What the program does (its functionality).
How the user should interact with the program (e.g., what inputs are expected).
What the user can expect as output.
Documentation for Developers:

Add comments to the code explaining the purpose of each function and major code sections. These comments should:
Explain how the individual parts of the code work.
Provide insights into why certain decisions were made in the code.
Clarify the purpose and significance of variables and functions.
Creating a Program Flowchart:

Draw or describe the program flow in the form of a flowchart or step-by-step guide.
The flowchart should outline all key steps of the program, from input to output.
This helps both users and developers understand the overall process of the program.
Compilation and Presentation:

Compile your documentation into a structured format.
Review your comments and the program flow for clarity and completeness.
Prepare a brief presentation or document where you showcase your work and explain the key points.
